Above are the 3d CAD files I used to build a fully flight capable f-20 tigershark jet airplane out of carbon fiber using 3d printed molds. 
This project took me about 8 months to complete and has many unique features such as deployable landing gear and disguised flaps. 
It is fully flight capable meaning it has a functioning electrical ducted fan with 2kg of thrust, a 6500 mAH battery, a 100 Amp electric speed controller and a 6 channel reciever.
The landing gear is opperated by 6 servos which control the flaps and landing gear. Each group of servos is controlled by a knop on the transmitter which is manually twisted to change positions.
